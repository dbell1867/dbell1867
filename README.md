- 👋 Hi, I’m @dbell1867
- 👀 I’m interested in Product Management, Data Science / Analytics, Python, and Microcontrollers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, CircuitPython and Arduino.  I have discovered that there is a difference between writing code that works and writing good quality code.  I write code that works, sometimes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... seems premature but I am looking for learning opportunities.
- 📫 How to reach me.         LinkedIn :  https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-bell-83a76051
